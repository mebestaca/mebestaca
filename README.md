### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring flutter developer. Been tinkering with flutter since the start of the pandemic. I made a lot of apps that uses Firebase, SQFlite, Bloc, and other packages to achieve the desired outcome. I'm interested in developing apps and programs using other languages as well apart from flutter. 

List of programming languages and technologies that I tried in a professional/non-professional/academic capacity:
  Turbo C, C++, C#, .NET, Oracle PL/SQL, MySQL, Access, VB6, Flutter/Dart, Java, Javascript, HTML, Jasscraft, Cobol, Batch, Python, Golang
